# OptimizedSystem

OptimizedSystem was launched in 2020 to provide known and also lesser known optimization possibilities for Windows in a clear and organized way. So any person can improve the performance of his/her system, no matter how much previous knowledge is given. Although Windows 10 is already quite a fast system (especially on modern hardware), there is still a lot of potential for improvement. This is because of unneeded programs, background services or poorly optimized settings which prevent the system from reaching its best state.

This project offers you the opportunity to improve this. The main aspects are performance, responsiveness, privacy and stability. This is especially important if the system is used for demanding applications and gaming. You can expect higher and more stable frame rates as well as a general improvement in terms of input lag, latency and privacy.

# Instructions

Unsure about using an OS template from an unofficial source? Then you have the possibility to download the default Windows OS template from Microsoft and perform the optimization manually.

Use the pre-tweaked OS template and save time on setup. Some features and options are already removed in advance, so you only have to worry about the configuration. Ideal for all people who are lazy and not so experienced regarding this subject.
